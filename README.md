# Speech-to-Text with SpeechRecognition

This Python project demonstrates how to convert speech into text using the Google Web Speech API via the `speech_recognition` library. It listens to the microphone input, processes the audio, and outputs the transcribed text.

## Features:
- **Speech Recognition**: Converts spoken language into text in real-time using Google's Web Speech API.
- **Background Noise Calibration**: Automatically adjusts for ambient noise to improve recognition accuracy.
- **Simple Setup**: No API keys or credentials required for using Googleâ€™s Speech API.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Supports multiple languages by specifying the language code.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- `speech_recognition` library
- Microphone or audio input device

## Installation:

To install the required Python libraries, use `pip`:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition
